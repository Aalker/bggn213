```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Call the package
```{r}
library(bio3d)
```

# Setup HIV-Pr for docking study

Get the protein
```{r}
file.name <- get.pdb("1hsg")
```

Read this file in and trim out the protein and small molecule ligand from everything else 

```{r}
hiv <- read.pdb(file.name)
#./ means that it lives locally
```

```{r}
ligand <- trim.pdb(hiv, "ligand")
ligand
```

Lets do the same for the protein
Extract protein

```{r}
protein <- trim.pdb(hiv, "protein")
protein
```

Write them up
```{r}
write.pdb(ligand, "1hsg_ligand.pdb")
write.pdb(protein, "1hsg_protein.pdb")
```
